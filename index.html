        and sarcasm</p>

      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>One day, I just started messing around on FreeCodeCamp 
        and fell in love. I missed that "AHA!" feeling you get
        seconds before figuring out a tough problem. I've 
        found that feeling continuously in coding, and I'm stoked
        to learn more.</p>
